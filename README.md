## 📝 Blog Content Strategy
### Markdown-Based Blog (Preferred Option)
- Blog content is stored in `/content/blogs` as `.md` files
- Each blog includes frontmatter metadata

**Sample Blog Markdown (`blog-1.md`)**
```
---
title: "My First Blog"
slug: "my-first-blog"
date: "2025-03-23"
description: "Intro to my blog"
coverImage: "/images/blog1.jpg"
---

# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blog content written in markdown...
```

### CMS-Based Blog (Optional - Not Required for Now)
- Use Sanity, Contentful, or Strapi (only if you prefer GUI editing)
- Fetch blogs using API in `getStaticProps`

---

## 🔄 Dynamic Blog Routing Flow
- `/blog/index.js`: Blog list page using blog metadata
- `/blog/[slug].js`: Dynamic page rendered using slug from each blog
- Use `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` for static generation

---

## 🚀 Deployment Plan
- Deploy using **Vercel**
- Store images in `/public/images`
- Add SEO metadata using `<Head>` in each page
